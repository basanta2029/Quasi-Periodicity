# Complete Submission Package for Dr. De Leo

## What You Have Now:

### 1. **Live GitHub Pages Version** (BEST OPTION)
- **URL**: https://basanta2029.github.io/Quasi-Periodicity/
- This has EVERYTHING working perfectly:
  - ✅ Full 2D interactive torus visualization
  - ✅ Full 3D interactive torus with rotation
  - ✅ Quasicrystal pattern generator
  - ✅ All mathematical content
  - ✅ All references and figures
- Dr. De Leo can access this directly without any downloads

### 2. **Complete ZIP Package** 
- **File**: `QuasiperiodicFunctions_Complete_2025.zip` (just created)
- Contains the entire docs folder structure
- Dr. De Leo would need to:
  1. Unzip the file
  2. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser
  3. The iframes will work properly pointing to js/ and js-3d/ folders
- This preserves the exact structure as online

### 3. **Self-Contained HTML Files**
- `QuasiperiodicFunctions_Complete_Package.html` - Attempts to embed everything (73.9 KB)
- `QuasiperiodicFunctions_Complete_Offline.html` - Has working embedded demos (45 KB)
- `QuasiperiodicFunctions_StandaloneEmail.html` - Simple version for printing (25 KB)

Subject: Quasiperiodic Functions Paper - Basanta Baral

Dear Dr. De Leo,

I am submitting my paper "Quasiperiodic Functions in Multiple Variables: Theory, Visualization, and Applications" for your review.

The paper is available in multiple formats:

1. **Online Version (Recommended)**: https://basanta2029.github.io/Quasi-Periodicity/
   - Full interactive experience with all visualizations
   - Works directly in your browser

2. **Offline Package**: Attached as QuasiperiodicFunctions_Complete_2025.zip
   - Unzip and open docs/index.html
   - All interactive features work offline

The paper includes:
- Interactive 2D and 3D visualizations of geodesics on the flat torus
- Quasicrystal pattern generators demonstrating wave interference
- Mathematical theory connecting torus geometry to quasiperiodic functions
- Applications to physics, crystallography, and pattern formation

Thank you for your guidance throughout this project. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Basanta Baral
