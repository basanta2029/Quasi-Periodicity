Subject: Quasiperiodic Functions Paper Submission - Basanta Baral

Dear Dr. De Leo,

I am submitting my paper "Quasiperiodic Functions in Multiple Variables: Theory, Visualization, and Applications" for your review.

The complete interactive paper is available at:
https://basanta2029.github.io/Quasi-Periodicity/docs/

This online version includes:
- Full mathematical exposition with proofs and examples
- Interactive visualizations of geodesics on the flat torus (2D and 3D)
- Dynamic quasicrystal pattern generators
- Applications to physics and crystallography
- Complete bibliography and references

I have also attached a ZIP file (QuasiperiodicFunctions_Complete_2025.zip) containing the complete offline version if you prefer to download it.

The paper explores the connection between torus geometry and quasiperiodic functions, with interactive demonstrations that allow real-time exploration of the mathematical concepts.

Thank you for your guidance and support throughout this project.

Best regards,
Basanta Baral
