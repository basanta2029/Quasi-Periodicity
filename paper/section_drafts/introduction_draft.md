# Introduction Section Draft

## Writing Points for Section 1

### 1.1 Historical Context

**Key points to cover:**
- Dan Shechtman's 1982 discovery at NIST
- Initial skepticism from scientific community (including Linus Pauling)
- 2011 Nobel Prize recognition
- Mathematical prehistory: Harald Bohr's almost periodic functions (1920s)
- Connection to Penrose tilings (1970s)

**Suggested narrative flow:**
1. Start with the "impossible" discovery
2. Explain why it challenged crystallography dogma  
3. Show how mathematics had already laid groundwork
4. Connect to modern applications

### 1.2 Motivation

**Three pillars structure:**

1. **Mathematical Beauty**
   - Example: How golden ratio appears in quasiperiodic patterns
   - Visual appeal of never-repeating patterns
   - Connection to number theory (Diophantine approximation)
   - Gateway to ergodic theory and dynamical systems

2. **Physical Relevance**
   - List real materials: Al-Mn alloys, Al-Cu-Fe, etc.
   - Applications: non-stick coatings, LED lights, surgical instruments
   - Theoretical importance: localization, electronic properties
   - Current research: twisted bilayer graphene

3. **Computational Exploration**
   - Contrast with pre-computer era
   - Power of interactive visualization
   - Ability to explore parameter spaces
   - Connection to your web apps

### 1.3 Paper Overview

**Structure explanation:**
- Foundation → Theory → Applications → Tools
- Emphasize hands-on approach with web tools
- Preview key results/insights

## Draft Text Example

Here's a sample opening paragraph:

"In 1982, materials scientist Dan Shechtman peered through his electron microscope at a rapidly cooled aluminum-manganese alloy and observed something that shouldn't exist: a crystal with five-fold symmetry. This discovery would challenge a fundamental tenet of crystallography—that crystals must have translational symmetry—and eventually earn Shechtman the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. What Shechtman had discovered was a quasicrystal, a material whose atomic arrangement is ordered but never repeats, embodying in physical form the mathematical concept of quasiperiodicity that had been studied abstractly for decades."

## Writing Tips

1. **Hook the reader**: Start with the surprise/paradox of quasicrystals
2. **Build bridges**: Connect pure math to physical reality
3. **Use analogies**: "Like a song that never repeats but always sounds familiar"
4. **Foreshadow**: Hint at the beautiful mathematics to come
5. **Be concrete**: Give specific examples early

## Transition to Section 2

End with something like:
"To understand these remarkable structures, we must first develop the mathematical framework of quasiperiodic functions. We begin with the simplest case: functions of a single variable..."
